ui-controls
===========

Couple UI Controls for angular that are still in work. 

Probably can be used as prototypes for some real controls.

Currently contains Grid and Menu. Menu is primitive, grid is heavy.

With grid there is an attempt to make it a bit similar to old Telerik Grid from Web Forms ages.
